```
This commnad is user to check the version of Git that is there.

2. Configuring GIT

We have to configure git by defining some global variable "user.name" and "user.email" this is reqjuired to make commit.

``` sh
git config --global user.name "<USER_NAME>"
git config --global user.email "<USER_EMAIL>"
```

```sh
git config --list 
``` 
This command will help checking that your changes worked or not.
