## Trying Common GIT Commands

1. Version Command
```sh

```
This commnad is user to check the version of Git that is there.

2. Configuring GIT

We have to configure git by defining some global variable "user.name" and "user.email" this is reqjuired to make commit.

``` sh
git config --global user.name "<USER_NAME>"
git config --global user.email "<USER_EMAIL>"
```
3. Check Configuration 
```sh
git config --list 
``` 
This command will help checking that your changes worked or not.

4. ```git status```
5. ```git add ```
6. ```git commit ```
7. ```git log```: prints information about recent commits like their time stamps,the author, and a commit message.
8. ```git help``` or can use ```git <command> --help```: that will tell you more about command and how to use it.
